/* Where a dialog opens.
 *
 * The About box opens in the middle of Illustrator's window, which is where
 * the host puts its own. Centering on the owner is the whole of the idea; the
 * rest is making sure the result is somewhere a person can reach.
 *
 * Centering alone is not enough, which is what this file is for. The box used
 * to center on the owner and stop there, so an Illustrator sitting against a
 * screen edge -- or spanning two monitors -- could put it half off the desktop
 * or under the taskbar, and the prose in it does not scroll. It is now pushed
 * back inside the work area of whatever monitor it lands on.
 *
 * The same file, with the same reasoning, is in LiveShear. Both plugins show
 * the same About window, and it is placed the same way in both.
 *
 * There are no Illustrator types here, for the same reason there are none in
 * SubgroupAbout.cpp: the About harness builds that file on its own, and this
 * header goes with it. There is no WIN_ENV guard either, for the same reason --
 * the harness does not define it, and this plugin is Windows-only regardless.
