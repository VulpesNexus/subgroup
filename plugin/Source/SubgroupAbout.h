/** The colors to draw the dialog in.

    Passed in rather than read here, which is the whole point: Illustrator knows
    what it is painting its own dialogs with, and this file must not know what
    Illustrator is. A plain struct of COLORREFs crosses that line without
    dragging the SDK across it, so tools/AboutHarness can still build this same
    file and show it -- in either theme, by filling this in itself.

    Defaults are the system colors, which is what the dialog looked like before
    it could be told otherwise, and what it still falls back to on a host that
    declines to say. */

    instead of being inspected only through the host - which for a modal dialog
    means not at all.

    @param  parent    owner window, may be null.
